# USE NEOVIM AS AN IDE
My thoughts to use neovim as an fully IDE.

## Outline

*1. Overview**
What is Vim?
Vim is a command line text editor. Vim was created around 1978. Vim is the most popular editor on the world.

It is minimal and clever editor with the main 4 modes: Normal, Insert, Visual and Visual Line.
- In Normal mode (press <Esc> to enter this mode): you can easily move the cursor with h,j,k,l or by other shortcuts.
- In Insert Mode (from Normal mode, press <i> to enter this mode): You could edit the text at the current cursor.
- In Visual mode (from Normal mode, press <v>): You can select your words and then have follow up action (often yank).
- Command mode: (from Normal mode, press <:>) for running a command.

The evolution from Vim to Neovim.
- With Lazy options, Neovim allow you to build a robust IDE like Vscode or Pycharm.
- Floating supported.
- Awsome plugins supported: Tresiter, LSP, Telescope.
- Configure in Lua.
- Nvim load the config from the ~/.config/ but vim is not. Vim's config file is `~/.vimrc`

Outstanding points of Neovim:
- It is recommended by many famous universities for programing students.

## 2. How to start with Neovim
Firstly, I highly recommend you to try using Neovim mode in your existing IDE. It could help you avoid being overwhelme by the Neovim world.
To get used to with Neovim, you could walk around with command: `vimtutor`

After getting familiar with Neovim style, you could switch to use the Neovim officially.

Here is basic steps to configure your customized Neovim:
1. Install Plugins in Neovim
2. Nvim configuration structure
